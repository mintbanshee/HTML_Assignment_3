🌙 Hero Poem (Homepage)

Beneath the hush of stars and pine,
we see the world through shadowed shine.
A story whispered in each frame,
where quiet light forgets its name.

🌠 Artist’s Poem (About Page or Gallery Intro)

By A. McQueen, 2008

Take me to the stars,
Home to my dreams.
Take me to that silent place,
Where nightmares fade away.

Lead me to the shadows,
Darkness is my light.
Lead me to that place of hope,
Where chaos fades and dies.

Leave me in the shadows,
Please wait for me.
Leave me in that star-filled sky,
Where I can just be me.
